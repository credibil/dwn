//! # Resumable Task Manager
//!
//! The task manager is responsible for running long-running or background
//! tasks â€” tasks that can be paused and restarted at a later time.
//!
//! The task manager is useful for long-running tasks that may be interrupted
//! by network issues or other problems. It is responsible for running the task
//! and ensuring that it is completed within a certain time frame.
//!
//! # Implementer Note:
//!
//! The implementation of the backing [`TaskStore`] must allow for
//! concurrent access by multiple `TaskStore` instances when used in a
//! multi-node deployment. It would be undesirable to have many node
//! instances attempting to run the same resumable task.
//!
//! A minimal viable implementation may use a per tenant lock on the store
//! when the `grab()`  method is called.
//!
//! A more performant, multi-node implementation could:
//!
//! 1. Use a persistent store for storing the data of each resumable task
//! 2. Use pub/sub to distribute task processing exclusively to a single
//!    subscribing task manager service.
//! 3. The `grab()` and/or `open()` implementation will need to publish
//!    expired tasks for distributed processing when there are no resumable
//!    tasks in the queue.
